# Module 3.4

# Question 1
# The difference between "pass" and "continue" is that
# when a pass statement is used, nothing happens. When a continue statement
# is used the current layer of the loop is skipped.

# Question 2
# letter = "Hizthere,zThisziszhowzazpasszstatementzworks!"
# for i in letter:
#     if i == "mn":
#         pass
#     elif i == "z":
#         print(" ",end="")
#     else:
#         print(i, end="")
# The program is iterating through the sting character by character.
# If it finds a character equal to "z" it prints a
# space(" "), if it doesn't, it prints the character.
# I'm honestly not sure why the "pass" is in here. Maybe I don't understand "pass" but
# I'm assuming here that it is just to show that nothing happens? I'm going to try
# to run the code without the pass line.
# yeah so, it doesn't seem to change anything.

# Question 3

# print("What shall I wear today?")
# name = input("Please Enter Your First Name: ")
# temp = int(input("What is Today's Temperature? "))
#
# if temp <= 70:
#     print(f'Hi {name}, You should probably bring a sweater')
# else:
#     print(f'HI {name}, It will be a warm day , T-shirt time!')

# p = lambda n: n**2
# result = p(4)
# print(result)
